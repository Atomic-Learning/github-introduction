<p>GitHub is a web-based platform that is widely used in software development for version control and collaborative coding. It uses the Git version control system to store and manage code in repositories hosted on GitHub's servers. It also contains a variety of useful features for developers including project management, issue tracking, code review, management of releases, documentation, hosting of some kinds of websites and wikis. GitHub is particularly useful for collaborative coding projects, but is also beneficial for individual developers working on personal projects as it allows easy remote backup and publication of their work.</p>

<p>GitHub is owned by Microsoft and is separate from Git, which is an open-source version control system. GitHub is one of several platforms that provide hosting for Git repositories, alongside others like GitLab and Bitbucket, although GitHub is the most popular of these services. It is central to many open-source, personal, and enterprise software development projects.</p>
